# Efficient-Image-Data-Dimensionality-Reduction-Using-CNN-Autoencoders
This project features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Autoencoder focused on dimensionality reduction for image data. The model compresses images into lower-dimensional representations while preserving essential features, making it ideal for tasks such as feature extraction and noise reduction.
